**Yeet.** is a Discord bot made with love by `Witherrüñ§#5417` that offers a range of unique and useful features to make your Discord experience more enjoyable. Below are some of its more prominent features!
I truly hope you can give it a try and enjoy the features that I've put tons of effort into :D!

## Features
### Draw/Pixel Art command
**Yeet.**'s `draw` command is a unique and original command where you can create pixel art directly on Discord using a wide range of features!
The draw command is the main feature of the bot that I have poured my heart and soul into over the course of 6+ months. This is not meant to be a profession drawing platform obviously, but it still provides an opportunity for fun regardless, to create and share goofy pixel art with your friends!
- Access various tools from a basic brush, fill tool to darken/lighten tools that automatically works behind the scenes to darken the pixel in your canvas, Using buttons and dropdown menus to provide a user-friendly interface
- Comes with a wide range of customizability to express the artist in you in a bite-size form
    - Add ANY custom colors
    - Extract and add colors from an **emoji** or **image**
    - Add emojis to the palette, and more
    - Mix multiple colours to create new colours
- It provides a bite-size but feature-packed drawing experience that you can have fun, with directly on discord
- More features such as exporting, timelapse, showcase forum, palette presets, etc are planned!

Here, I roughly recreated my discord profile picture!

### Define command
**Yeet.**'s `define` command allows you to find various information on a term or phrase, including definitions, examples, synonyms, etc. The information is presented in a neat and paginated format, which you can interact with using buttons and dropdown menus. Settle that debate about the meaning of a word or find that word at the tip of your tongue without even having to leave the app!

### Gist command
**Yeet.**'s `gist` command provides an intuitive interface to interact with Github Gists, allowing users to create, edit, delete, and view gists, etc directly from discord. The interface uses dropdown menus, pagination between files, buttons, and modals to make it easy to input and edit text into gists. With this command, you can easily share snippets of code or other text with your friends without having to leave Discord or the hassle of finding a reliable paste service.

### Calculator command
**Yeet.**'s `calculator` command provides a unique and interactive calculator interface using buttons that can be used to perform arithmetic calculations quickly with its intuitive and easy to use interface. **Yeet.** also offers a simple calculator command for when you need quick calculations without all that fanciness!

### Pok√©two helper commands
Pok√©two is a Pok√©mon discord bot. **Yeet.** offers unique helper commands for it, such as
- Extracting Pok√©mon IDs directly from an embed
- Viewing the spawn chance of different Pok√©mon, rarities, forms, type combinations, event Pok√©mon, and more
- A `moveinfo` command that allows you to view move information such as *all the Pok√©mon that learn a move*, which can be useful in a pinch during a battle
All these commands sync directly with the Pok√©two game data to provide you with 100% accurate information that may otherwise be difficult to find.

### Channel commands
**Yeet.** provides unique channel commands that allow you to perform modification tasks on channels, such as lock, unlock, rename, strip, and more. With **Yeet.**'s channel commands, you can easily manage your Discord channels.

### Wikipedia command
**Yeet.**'s `wikipedia` command allows you to find Wikipedia information about any topic using the Wikipedia API. The wikipedia command works hand-in-hand with the define command to provide you with information at your fingertips.

### Other features
**Yeet.** also improves upon features from other bots, such as R. Danny, such as
- Intuitive pagination of appropriate commands (improved upon to match **Yeet.**'s needs)
- Discord.py documentation command to view documentation of the library, improved upon by pagination using buttons
- A robust help command inherited from R. Danny's help command to provide a highly customized help command to suit the user's needs
- A intuitive info command to view user info, improved upon by adding role support
- A permissions command to view the permissions of a member of a server
- Error handling in various cases, taking from Pok√©two and improved up to match my needs.

## Planned features
**Yeet.** is still in its early stages, and much more content is planned. I'll be adding new unique features and improving upon old ones to make **Yeet.** even more feature-packed and enjoyable to use.

## Conclusion
Overall, **Yeet.** is a versatile and feature-packed Discord bot that offers a truly unique experience. From the pixel art drawing command to the dictionary and calculator commands, there is something for everyone. The bot also provides a range of convenient helper commands for the popular Poketwo bot, as well as improvements on existing features such as beautiful pagination and Discord.py documentation from R. Danny.

As the bot is still in its early stages, there is much more planned in terms of new features and improvements. But with its polished design, intuitive interface, and one-of-a-kind functionality, **Yeet.** is already a bot that users will find valuable and enjoyable.
