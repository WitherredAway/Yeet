# **Yeet.** Discord Bot
**Yeet.** is a Discord bot made with love by 'Witherrüñ§#5417' that offers a range of unique and useful features to make your Discord experience more enjoyable. Below are some of its more prominent features!
it is still in its very early stages, despite the age of the repository and hence is not yet public, but is planned sometime soon after ironing out the kinks! I truly hope you can give it a try and enjoy the features that I've put tons of effort into :D!

## Features
### Draw/Pixel Art command
**Yeet.**'s `draw` command is a unique one-of-a-kind command where you can create pixel art directly on Discord using custom emojis and custom emoji palettes. Using buttons and dropdown menus, you can access various tools like a brush, fill tool, darken/lighten tools, and more. You can also enhance the experience with the wide range of customizability that comes with adding ANY custom colors, extracting colors from an emoji or image, adding emojis to the palette, and more. The draw command is the main feature of the bot that I have poured my heart and soul into over the course of 6+ months. It provides a feature-packed drawing experience that you can have fun with directly on discord.

### Define command
**Yeet.**'s define command allows you to find various information on a term or phrase, including definitions, examples, synonyms, etc. The information is presented in a neat and paginated format, which you can interact with using buttons and dropdown menus. Settle that debate about the meaning of a word or find that word at the tip of your tongue without even having to leave the app!

### Gist command
**Yeet.**'s gist command provides an intuitive interface to interact with Github Gists, allowing users to create, edit, delete, and view gists directly from discord. The interface uses dropdown menus, pagination between files, buttons, and modals to make it easy to input and edit text into gists. With **Yeet.**'s gist command, you can easily share snippets of code or other text with your friends without having to leave Discord or the hassle of finding a reliable paste service.

### Calculator command
**Yeet.**'s calculator command provides a unique and interactive calculator interface using buttons that can be used to perform arithmetic calculations quickly with its intuitive and easy to use interface. **Yeet.** also offers a simple calculator command for when you need quick calculations without all that fanciness!

### Pok√©two helper commands
Pok√©two is a Pok√©mon discord bot. **Yeet.** offers unique helper commands for it, such as *extracting Pok√©mon IDs directly from an embed*, *viewing the spawn chance of different Pok√©mon, rarities, forms, type combinations, event Pok√©mon, and more*. In addition, it features a `moveinfo` command that allows you to view move information such as *all the Pok√©mon that learn a move*, which can be useful in a pinch during a battle. All these commands sync directly with the Pok√©two database to provide you with 100% accurate information that may otherwise be difficult to find.

### Channel commands
**Yeet.** provides unique channel commands that allow you to perform modification tasks on channels, such as lock, unlock, rename, strip, and more. With **Yeet.**'s channel commands, you can easily manage your Discord channels.

### Wikipedia command
**Yeet.**'s wikipedia command allows you to find Wikipedia information about any topic using the Wikipedia API. The wikipedia command works hand-in-hand with the define command to provide you with information at your fingertips.

### Other features
**Yeet.** also improves upon features from other bots, such as R. Danny, such as intuitive pagination of appropriate commands (improved upon to match **Yeet.**'s needs) and a Discord.py documentation command that is paginated using buttons (improved upon). It also inherits from R. Danny's help command to provide a highly customized help command to suit the user's needs.

## Planned features
**Yeet.** is still in its early stages, and much more content is planned. I'll be adding new unique features and improving upon old ones to make **Yeet.** even more feature-packed and enjoyable to use.

## Conclusion
Overall, **Yeet.** is a versatile and feature-packed Discord bot that offers a truly unique experience. From the pixel art drawing command to the dictionary and calculator commands, there is something for everyone. The bot also provides a range of convenient helper commands for the popular Poketwo bot, as well as improvements on existing features such as beautiful pagination and Discord.py documentation from R. Danny.

As the bot is still in its early stages, there is much more planned in terms of new features and improvements. But with its polished design, intuitive interface, and one-of-a-kind functionality, **Yeet.** is already a bot that users will find valuable and enjoyable.
